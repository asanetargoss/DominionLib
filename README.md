# DominionLib

## About

DominionLib is a faithful fork of McHorse's McLib library mod, with more or less the same features, such as:

  * GUI framework
  * Ernio's network base code
  * Math expression parser

## Installing

Just as Changeling is meant to be a drop-in replacement for Metamorph, DominionLib is meant to be a drop-in replacement for McLib. It uses the same mod id as McLib ("mclib"), so you have to choose between having either DominionLib or McLib installed. If you are having trouble deciding, here is a handy guide:

  * Changeling versions released in March 2020 or earlier: use McLib
  * Newer Changeling versions: Use DominionLib
  * All Metamorph versions: Use McLib

The version you use is important. The [Changeling releases page](https://github.com/asanetargoss/Changeling/releases) tells you which library version to use with the provided Changeling version.

## Bugs

Please report any issues caused by DominionLib to the [Changeling issue tracker](https://github.com/asanetargoss/Changeling/issues).
